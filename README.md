# C++ Programs

These are C++ Programs I wrote while taking a C++ Course. 
1. The first program in the folder, "Clock Program", simulates an alarm clock. The user sets the current time and alarm time in military time. The current time runs until the alarm time is reached, ending the program with an "Alarm Active" message.
2. The second program in the folder, "Puzzle Game Final Program", simulates a mazelike game where a user (G) must reach a target (X) without being caught by the enemies (T). There are three modes: easy, medium, and hard. The user can move one space up, down, left, and right (using the w, s, a, d respectively) along the map for each turn. The enemies are a simple AI programmed to move one space in any direction after each turn. The player loses if caught by an enemy, and the player wins if they reach the target.

Refer to the "C-Programs-Screenshots.pdf" for output examples.
